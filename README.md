## webaudio-synth


This is a simple oscillator controlled by MIDI intput in the browser using the webaudio api that I built as a Flatiron School project.

The goal was to be able to use an external MIDI device to control a web application and learn how to use the webaudio api in preperation for my final project for FI. 


In the CLI from the synth-frontend folder: npm run dev to run - requires a MIDI device to use (currently setup for M-Audio Oxygen25).
